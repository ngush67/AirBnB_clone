# Airbnb Clone
## Description 
This is the first phase of the Airbnb Clone: the console. This repository holds a command interpreter and classes (i.e. BaseModel class and several other classes that inherit from it: Amenity, City, State, Place, Review), and a command interpreter. The command interpreter, like a shell, can be activated, take in user input, and perform certain tasks to manipulate the object instances.
